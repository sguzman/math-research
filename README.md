# Math Research
A list of topics in mathematics that I have researched to some degree OR wish to research. Mind the aspirational tone

## Topics
- Convolution with $e^{-x^2}$ as a _cursor_
- Convolution $\int{e^{-x^2}f(x)(g(x)-t)}dt$ as incremental application of function `f(x)` onto `g(x)` substrate
