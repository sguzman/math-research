# Math Research
A list of topics in mathematics that I have researched to some degree OR wish to research. Mind the aspirational tone

## Topics
- Convolution with $e^{-x^2}$ as a _cursor_
- Convolution $\int{e^{-x^2}f(x)(g(x)-t)}dt$ as incremental application of function `f(x)` onto `g(x)` substrate
- Cartesian plane as a binary switch board on some field
- Unit Circle Projection
- Developing programming primitives from real analysis operands
- Solving collatz conjecture using operator theory
- Having a function reference itself
- Develop an operator that can `iterate` a number an indefinite number of times
- Integral transform for length of orbits of collatz conjecture
- Modified collatz conjecture that adds `collatz(1) = 0` and `collatz(0) = 0`
- Deconstructing a function by dot product of its derivative to other function
- Scanning line across a function with dot product
- Multiplying by x as inbuing of curvature
- All single-term polynomials have complete curvature of 2
- Curvature as a measure of information
- Curvature as a program to steer function
- A torus that culminates at a pinched point at one side
- Algebra as a crude mechanic process
- Algebraic expressions as a sequence of associative function compositions
- Integral transforms extract and count properties of functions
- Fractional application of a function
- Treating [0,1] as a torus
- Sinify a function
- Curve-filling (space filling) curve
- An equation as a manipulatible algebraic object
- Compressed executable that is semantically equivalent to uncompressed
- An expression as a program
- Normalizing a program to a mathematical expression
- All math fields should have some way of uniquely mappings their idiosyncratic algebraic objects back to integers
- Curves are an infinite series of linear terms
- The more curvy, the more linear terms is needed to duplicated it
- `e` is the function number(?)
- `e` is a self-referencial number(?)
- Inside a sum is a more expressive language
- Function that spits out number of rounds needed for a space curve to hit a random (a,b) in R^2
- Nested operations maximize the expressiveness of the syntax
- Generalized unit measure - allows you to measure anything measurable relatively
- Rigorous formalism for how mapping Reals (and reals subsets) to Reals functions - for example that just take a line and stretch it
- f[x]+f'[x] I
- f[x]+ ArcCurvature[{x,f[x]},x] I
- x ^2 == c; algebraic diff between sqrt and div by x
- integration as picking random algortihm to add up area
- all integrations can be set from a to b to 0 to 1
- there is a direct line ( no need for euler-lagrange optimization) in a set if the geometry of the boundary is a convex hull on the interior set
- does homeomorphism always imply homeomorphism between boundaries?
- does euler-lagrange equation map to an easier problem and then solve it?
- what is the manual analogue of calculus of variation?
- Discrete/Continuous invariant calculus
- using complex numbers to model curvature
