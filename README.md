# Math Research
A list of topics in mathematics that I have researched to some degree OR wish to research. Mind the aspirational tone

## Topics
- Convolution with $e^{-x^2}$ as a _cursor_
- Convolution $\int{e^{-x^2}f(x)(g(x)-t)}dt$ as incremental application of function `f(x)` onto `g(x)` substrate
- Cartesian plane as a binary switch board on some field
- Unit Circle Projection
- Developing programming primitives from real analysis operands
- Solving collatz conjecture using operator theory
- Having a function reference itself
- Develop an operator that can `iterate` a number an indefinite number of times
- Integral transform for length of orbits of collatz conjecture
- Modified collatz conjecture that adds `collatz(1) = 0` and `collatz(0) = 0`
- Deconstructing a function by dot product of its derivative to other function
- Scanning line across a function with dot product
- Multiplying by x as inbuing of curvature
- All single-term polynomials have complete curvature of 2
- Curvature as a measure of information
- Curvature as a program to steer function
- A torus that culminates at a pinched point at one side
- Algebra as a crude mechanic process
- Algebraic expressions as a sequence of associative function compositions
- Integral transforms extract and count properties of functions
- Fractional application of a function
- Treating [0,1] as a torus
- Sinify a function
- Curve-filling (space filling) curve
- An equation as a manipulatible algebraic object
- Compressed executable that is semantically equivalent to uncompressed
- An expression as a program
- Normalizing a program to a mathematical expression
- All math fields should have some way of uniquely mappings their idiosyncratic algebraic objects back to integers
- Curves are an infinite series of linear terms
- The more curvy, the more linear terms is needed to duplicated it
- `e` is the function number(?)
- `e` is a self-referencial number(?)
- Inside a sum is a more expressive language
- Function that spits out number of rounds needed for a space curve to hit a random (a,b) in R^2
- Nested operations maximize the expressiveness of the syntax
- Generalized unit measure - allows you to measure anything measurable relatively
- Rigorous formalism for how mapping Reals (and reals subsets) to Reals functions - for example that just take a line and stretch it
- f[x]+f'[x] I
- f[x]+ ArcCurvature[{x,f[x]},x] I
- x ^2 == c; algebraic diff between sqrt and div by x
- integration as picking random algortihm to add up area
- all integrations can be set from a to b to 0 to 1
- there is a direct line ( no need for euler-lagrange optimization) in a set if the geometry of the boundary is a convex hull on the interior set
- does homeomorphism always imply homeomorphism between boundaries?
- does euler-lagrange equation map to an easier problem and then solve it?
- what is the manual analogue of calculus of variation?
- Discrete/Continuous invariant calculus
- Using the laplacian operator to incrementally/analytically convert any function to another in a continuous manner
- using complex numbers to model curvature
- Representing $R^2$ as a matrix centered around the origin with infinite rows and columns
- Representing a curve on $R^2$ using a field of boolean values
- Representing a curve as a $R^2$ matrix of 1s and 0s where the 1s are the position of points of the curve
- Multiplying two $R^2$ matrix curves to find intersection points
- Extending the dimensions of a row as a operation by adding or substracting new rows or columns with 0s
- For every class of functions (harmonics, elliptic, polynomials), there is a function involving the exponent of e that can emulate it to some degree
- Nested riemann sum: While taking a riemann sum, use another riemann to calculate the error of the raw sum
- Using the Dirac Delta function as a zero-detector. Feed it a formula that = 0. Integrate it dirac delta function; then what results is a step function that takes a step function that takes a step at every 0
- Creating a relativized version of $R^2$ where the identity curve , $f(x)=x$, is equivalent to another function like $x^2$ or $sin(x)$
- Understanding the derivative of a function in reference to another function
- Function semantics that comphrensively handles recursive call bombs
- Extracting range from integral and creating a dedicated "iterator" object (similar to programming)
- Exp[x]== x^(x/Log[x])
- Measure using number of open problems as relative health of mathematic formalisms
- Analytic formalisms for function application to incrementally apply and compose functions
- Tool must contain a commensurate amount of infinity as the problem
- Duality between structure and dynamics. Structure can be interpreted as dynamics if you re-interpret one of the dimensions of structure as a time
- Destructuring a real curve into holomorphic function. Re[f(x)] is scaling and Im[f(x)] is rotation
- Creating a general functional iterator that takes a function and composes itself once. This general functional iterator can be easily composed
- Symbol fatigue and math anxiety
- Holomorphic functional calculus for iterated real functions of one variable
